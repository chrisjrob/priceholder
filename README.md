Price Holder
============

Description
-----------

Some of our shop displays end up with dozens of price tickets stuck with sticky tape around the shop.

This thing is designed to hold any number of price labels, with the ability to specify the number of rows and columns.

Once printed, you should be able to slot in the price labels, for a neat and tidy shop display.

Instructions
------------

Edit the openscad file specifying the size of the labels and the required number of labels across and down (columns and rows), along with the padding (space between labels), thickness of the overall item, roundedness of the corners and the size of the retaining overlap.

It uses an overhang to hold the labels in place - and clearly overhangs can be tricky with 3d printers, for the purposes of Thingiverse I have set to a 2mm overlap, but you will probably wish to reduce to 1mm to facilitate printing.
